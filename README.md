# nfl_wr_classifier
A model that categorizes NFL wide receivers by playing style, using the following data:
- Play-by-play data from Sportradar (via API)
- Receiver-level data from Pro Football Focus Premium
- Receiver-level data from the NFL Scouting Combine (via nflverse library)
- Receiver-level data from NFL Next Gen Stats (via nflverse library)

## Future Changes
- Will likely use K-Means.
- Will eventually include different seasons so that a unique player-season pair represents one row.
